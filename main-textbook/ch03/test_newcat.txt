Blinken: Condolences for killed Fox News journalists
The US Secretary of State has tweeted about the deaths of Fox News journalists Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, an Irish national, and Oleksandra Kuvshinova, 24, a Ukrainian.

They were killed outside Kyiv when their vehicle came under fire from Russian troops.

"I am grateful to all those risking their lives to show the world what is happening in Ukraine," Anthony Blinken said.

"The United States condemns Russia's ongoing violence, which is putting the safety of journalists and other media workers in Ukraine at risk."

On Sunday, another journalist and war zone veteran, Brent Renaud, died when Russian troops shot him at a checkpoint in Irpin, just outside Kyiv.
